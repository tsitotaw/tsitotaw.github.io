    <ol>
        <li>
            What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
            <ul>
                <li>setTimeout(booyah, 2000);</li>
                <li>setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p class="answer">
                the difference is the first booyah with the parentesis will wait until the wait time is over, which is 2000 in this cases
                whereas, the second booyah function will be called immmediately without waiting the timer
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
            <p>
                var myfunc = function(a, x) { <br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return a * x;<br/>
                   };<br/>
                   var x = myfunc(2, 3);<br/>
                   var y = myfunc;<br/>
                   alert(x);<br/>
                   alert(y(2,3));
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                Both will alert to the same value 6. As functions are first class citizens, just like variable assignment, function assignments are possible - 
                the only difference of the two alert calls is one accepts a variable, the other a function - but the result is the same
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
            says “BOOYAH!”
            <ul>
                <li>setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);</li>
                <li>setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p class="answer">
                function booyah1(){ <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    alert("“BOOYAH!"); <br/>
                }<br/>

                function booyah2(){ <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    setTimeout(booyah1, 2000); <br/>
                }<br/>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
            for using it)?
            <p class="answer">
                        Unobtrusive Javascript is kind of a design philosophy and opinioin, 
                        which guide us to separate our HTML structure and JS behaviors - doing that will help us implement separation of concerns 
                        and keep our codes clean. 

                        by removing the embedded script logic and the event handlers from HTML, we made sure our HTML page will work
                        regardless of any external dependency - in case browsers donot support JS, or JS is disabled, 
                        or make the site's content accessible for visually impaired or search engines or any other reason, 
                        our app will work in its basic form. 

                        But then, if everything is in place, we can add the additional behavior using our JS, when allowed,
                        which inturn will use the global document object to put its magic.

                        Also, by moving JS out, we can help developers only focus on specific technology and also easily introduce caching, minifing, uglifing, concatinating 
                        and all other techniques and boost the performance of our app
