jQuery Quiz II

1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
    
    //code fragment 1
    $("li").each(function(idx, e) {
        $(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); });

    //code fragment 2
    $("li").each(function() {
        $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
    
    //code fragment 3
    $("li").each(function(idx) {
        $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });


    => In the case of the current implementation, all the three forms accomplish exactly
        the same thing. $(e) and $(this) are one and the same.
        if we had special scenario, like, making some changes based on the index of the list,
        having the index as parameter and missing it would have make the difference.
        


2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make
their text color be blue.
        <div>no ul here </div>
        <div>
            This does contain a ul.
            <ul>
                <li>the first item</li>
                <li>the second item</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <script>
            $(document).ready(function(){
                $("div").has("ul").css("color", "blue");
            });
        </script>
    </body>
3. Write jQuery code to append the following div element (and all of its contents) dynamically to the body
element.

HTML:
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>JS Bin</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function(){
            $("<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>").appendTo(document.body);
        });
    </script>
 </html>
