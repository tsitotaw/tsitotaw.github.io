1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?
    => “the jQuery function”
            The jQuery function is the value of jQuery or of $. 
            This is the function that creates jQuery objects and registers handlers to be invoked when the DOM is ready; 
            it also serves as the jQuery namespace. 
    => “jQuery object”
        A jQuery object is an object returned by the jQuery function. 
        A jQuery object represents a set of document elements and can also be called a “jQuery result”, a “jQuery set”, or a “wrapped set”.


2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
color red.
Sample HTML:
<body>
<h1>abc</h1><br><div>
 <h1>div-1</h1>
 <h1>div-2</h1>
 </div>
 <h1>xyz</h1>
</body>

    => $(div h1).css("background-color", "red")


3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" integrity="sha256-H+K7U5CnXl1h5ywQfKtSj8PCmoN9aaq30gDh27Xc0jk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <script>
            $(function(){
                let pContent = $('p').html();
                $('p').html(pContent + " YES!");
            });            
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        >Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
    </body>
</html>
